## Overview 

We performed deep mutational scans to measure the impact on receptor-binding and RBD folding of all single amino-acid mutations in MERS-CoV and PDF-2180 RBD backgrounds. We measured binding affinity (log10Ka) for the DPP4 ortholog from human. We also determined mutational effects on RBD expression levels.

Here, we link to two interactive visualizations that enable exploration of the data from these deep mutational scans.


### Instructions 

We have made two tools to help visualize the data from our deep mutational scans:

1. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore **change** in receptor binding (delta-log10Ka) and expression (delta-logMFI) for each RBD variant. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps_delta.md %}).

2. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore the **absolute**receptor binding affinity (log10Ka) and RBD expression (logMFI) of each RBD variant. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps_absolute.md %}).

### Data

If you are interested in the raw data from our study, you can find the mutant phenotypes from each experiment [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/MERS-PDF2180-RBD_DMS_/tree/main/results/final_variant_scores).
